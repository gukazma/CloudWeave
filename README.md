## 🌐 Overview

**CloudWeave** is a high-performance C++ library designed for processing **oblique aerial imagery** and reconstructing accurate, textured 3D models of urban and natural landscapes. Built with efficiency, modularity, and cross-platform support in mind, it bridges classical photogrammetry principles with modern computer vision pipelines — all under the poetic vision of *weaving reality from the sky*.

Inspired by the Chinese myth of the **Heavenly Weaver** (织女), who wove clouds into celestial brocade, CloudWeave transforms fragmented aerial views into seamless digital twins of the real world.
